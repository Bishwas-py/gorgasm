# Go WebAssembly Todo App

A modern, responsive todo application built entirely with Go and WebAssembly - no JavaScript required (except for the
WebAssembly initialization)!

## Features

- âœ… Create, toggle, and delete todos
- ðŸ“Š Filter todos by status (All/Active/Completed)
- ðŸ’¾ Persistent storage using LocalStorage
- ðŸ”„ Automatic state synchronization
- ðŸ“± Responsive design that works on all devices
- ðŸš€ Pure Go implementation (no JavaScript code needed)

## Technology Stack

- **Go** - Backend logic compiled to WebAssembly
- **WebAssembly** - Frontend execution environment
- **HTML/CSS** - UI structure and styling
- **LocalStorage** - Client-side data persistence

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.16+ (with WebAssembly support)
- A modern web browser

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gorgasm.git
   cd gorgasm
   ```

2. Build and run the application:
   ```bash
   make serve
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

### Manual Build

1. Copy the WebAssembly support JavaScript:
   ```bash
   cp "$(go env GOROOT)/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js" static/
   ```

2. Compile the Go code to WebAssembly:
   ```bash
   GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o static/main.wasm ./pkg/ui/wasm
   ```

3. Build and run the server:
   ```bash
   go build -o server ./cmd/server
   ./server
   ```

## How It Works

This todo app demonstrates a unique approach to web development by using Go for both frontend and backend logic. Here's
how it works:

1. **Server**: A simple Go HTTP server serves static files.

2. **WebAssembly**: Go code is compiled to WebAssembly that runs in the browser.

3. **DOM Abstraction**: The app includes a custom DOM manipulation library written in Go that provides a JavaScript-like
   API for interacting with the DOM.

4. **LocalStorage**: A Go wrapper for browser's LocalStorage API enables persistent data storage.

5. **Event Handling**: All user interactions (clicks, key presses) are handled directly by Go code.

### Key Components

- **Todo Model**: Simple data structure with ID, text, completion status, and timestamp.
- **Event Handlers**: Functions that respond to user interactions.
- **Rendering Logic**: Go code that dynamically updates the DOM based on state changes.
- **Filter System**: Logic to show todos based on their completion status.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Todo editing functionality
- [ ] Drag-and-drop reordering
- [ ] Dark mode theme
- [ ] Due dates and priorities
- [ ] Multiple todo lists
- [ ] Syncing with a backend server
